# Parity audit — the truth ledger

- **Status:** the tense-law ledger. Every feature-tree F-id maps to its real
  status with the acceptance test that proves it or the honest reason it
  doesn't. Updated 2026-06-17 after the go-live hardening wave (see below);
  prior baseline 2026-06-12 (R1→R4 mandate). No public claim outside what a
  ✅ row's test/bench backs.
- Legend: ✅ done + tested · 🟡 mechanism shipped, capability gated on
  hardware/spike (honest probe, not silent) · ⏳ deferred to a named future
  ring · ➖ doc/process item.

## Go-live status (2026-06-17)

The go-live hardening wave merged gate-green: **411 tests, 0 failures**, clippy
`-D` clean (default + `--features vz`), fmt clean. Three honest tiers:

- **DONE (validated + tested):** the entire Stage-1 local product — store,
  index, all R0 verbs, run-control, gc, time-axis, OCI import (sha256-verified),
  build (memoized), lazy compose, docker compat, the full agent surface,
  schemas. The **vz engine is runtime-validated end-to-end on Intel x86_64**
  (F-205/F-206). F-103 view **materialization ships as CoW hydrate** (real +
  tested). This wave added: per-crate crates.io publish metadata (11 crates +
  workspace), CLI polish (`completions`/`man`/`--version` git-sha+build-date,
  help examples + tests), compose services that **hydrate** their `image_ref`
  into the run cwd (closed the R4 temp-dir shortcut), and 2 vacuous compile-only
  index tests upgraded to real snapshot/hydrate + status roundtrips.
- **PRESS-GO (owner / hardware-gated — NOT validated):** crates.io publish is
  owner-gated (`G-PUBLISH`, workspace `publish = false`); naming is CLEARED
  (`lightr` + `hugr-lightr` free) but brew formula + install.sh carry
  post-release placeholders; the 5-target CI matrix + macOS signing wait on
  owner secrets. Runtime validation of **arm64 vz boot** and **Windows wsl** is
  hardware-gated (owner/borrowed HW or CI) — code-complete with recipes/runbooks,
  none claimed validated. (**Linux ns is now VALIDATED** on GitHub-hosted CI —
  see F-204 / the validated tier below.) The publish runbook is `docs/RELEASE.md`.
- **STAGED (post-GA per whitepaper roadmap — not go-live blockers):** fc engine,
  cross-tenant dedup, CoreLink Stage-2 sync, LAN mesh, full networking
  (DNS/VPN), resource limits (needs ns/vz runtime), registry push, Rosetta,
  agent profiles, deep-memo nitro shim, healthcheck/secrets, restart-via-OS
  supervisor. The O(1) view backends (composefs/NFS-loopback/projfs) are a
  STAGED **perf optimization** (ADR-0013 planned spike, honest + unwired) — not
  a correctness gap.

## Store & index (R0)
| F | Feature | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| F-001 | File-level CAS objects | ✅ | A1, A7; lightr-store unit |
| F-002 | CoW ladder + materialize | ✅ | A1; bench B3′ (rung=Clone on APFS). **+Windows ReFS rung** (`CowRung::RefsBlockClone`, FSCTL_DUPLICATE_EXTENTS_TO_FILE, best-effort → `std::fs::copy` fallback = required-correct path; WIN-PATH, runtime on a ReFS volume) |

## Verbs / warp core (R0)
| F | Feature | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| F-101 | stat-index | ✅ | lightr-index units; A5 |
| F-102 | snapshot ≤budget warm | ✅ | bench B5b (233 ms@2k, machine-class) |
| F-103 | hydrate CoW (R0) / O(1) view (R2) | ✅ R0 / ⏳ O(1) backend | A1; bench B3′. **Shipped materialization = CoW hydrate (✅ real + tested)** via `lightr_index`. `lightr-views` crate: ViewPlan + Solidifier pure logic host-tested; O(1) backends (composefs/NFS-loopback/projfs) reframed HONEST — return `ErrorKind::Unsupported` ("planned spike per ADR-0013; shipped runtime materializes via CoW hydrate"). Verified **NOT wired into the run path** (no active stub). O(1) is a perf optimization (ADR-0013 spike), not a correctness gap |
| F-104 | status | ✅ | A5; bench B6 |
| F-105 | run memoized | ✅ | A2, A3. **Extended to the vz/container path (WP-VZMEMO, 2026-06-18):** `run --engine vz --rootfs <ref> -- <cmd>` now memoizes {exit, stdout, stderr} keyed by `command + rootfs-content-digest + env + os/arch` (`vz_memo_key`, domain-separated `lightr-vz-memo-v1`, length-prefixed) — a 2nd identical run replays from the Action Cache with **NO VM boot**. `run_vz_memoized` mirrors `run_memoized_with`'s CAS/AC law exactly (cache only `exit==0 && ≤OUTPUT_CAP_BYTES`). Guest PID1 captures the command's stdout/stderr to `STDOUT_FILE`/`STDERR_FILE` (fsync before the console marker); the host reads them on a MISS, stores in CAS. `GUEST_PATH` is one source of truth (lightr_init, re-exported via lightr_engine) so the key can't drift from the engine's injected env. Measured Intel: HIT **0.014 s** vs docker re-run **1.30 s = 93×**, unbounded (re-run is flat; scales with work + reuse). The memoize-first thesis applied to Linux containers — Docker has no memory. |
| F-106 | memo replay ≤budget | ✅ | bench B4 |
| F-107 | no-daemon | ✅ | A4, A9 (pid/ctl scoped) |
| F-108 | offline-absolute core | ✅ | A6 |
| F-109 | CLI overhead <budget | ✅ | bench B1 (7 ms) |

## Engines (R1 native / R2 tiers)
| F | Feature | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| F-201 | native engine | ✅ | A19; lightr-engine unit |
| F-202 | exec/logs/ps/stop | ✅ | A9, A10, A9b, A9e |
| F-203 | resource limits | ✅ ns cgroup RUNTIME-VALIDATED (#90) / native honest | **WP-A1 (2026-06-18) + #90 (2026-06-25):** memory — Linux native `RLIMIT_AS`+`DATA` (`pre_exec`); macOS/Windows native honest `Err`→`--engine vz`. cpu-share + pids — native honest `Err`→ns. ns — cgroup v2 `memory.max`/`cpu.max`/**`pids.max`**. vz — shim FFI `memorySize`/`cpuCount` (pids → honest CLI error: VM has no per-container cgroup). **#90 RUNTIME-VALIDATED on GitHub-hosted Linux CI as root** (`linux-validation.yml` resource-limits job): `--memory 64m` OOM-kills an allocator, `--cpus 0.5` runs limited, `--pids-limit 4` forks fail with EAGAIN (control clean). **Two real gaps #90 fixed:** (a) `--pids-limit` was a documented NO-OP (`apply_pids_limit` discarded its args) — now enforced via cgroup `pids.max`; (b) `apply_cgroup` ran AFTER `pivot_root`, where `/sys/fs/cgroup` is the container's empty dir, so cgroup caps NEVER actually applied at runtime (the prior "✅ Linux-mem" was wired-but-non-functional) — moved before `pivot_root`. CAVEAT: cgroup writes go to the host cgroup-v2 root, so enforcement needs **root or a delegated subtree**; rootless-without-delegation fails closed with an honest error. (Container `/dev` is device-less — tracked #91, separate.) |
| F-204 | ns engine (Linux) | ✅ | **RUNTIME-VALIDATED on GitHub-hosted Linux CI (ubuntu-latest, public reproducible hardware), 2026-06-25.** Two green proofs: (1) **cold-start benchmark** `lightr run --engine ns --net=none` ran 100/100 ok at ~30.8 ms (full `CLONE_NEWUSER|NEWNS|NEWPID|NEWNET` + pivot_root, rootless) — ~4.05× faster than rootless podman `--network=none` at the SAME isolation + privilege (`docs/benchmarks/RESULTS.md`); (2) **network-namespace isolation** functionally proven (`linux-validation.yml` ns-net-isolation job: host-net reaches a host listener, `--net=none` cannot). A real uid/gid-map bug was found+fixed during validation (read ids before `unshare`). HONEST caveats: rootless ns is **not** a hostile-tenant boundary (use `vz`/`fc`); needs `kernel.apparmor_restrict_unprivileged_userns=0` on hardened hosts (honest error otherwise); not yet battle-tested at production scale. probe honest on macOS (A19). **CRI backend netns/CNI FULL lifecycle also validated on Linux CI (#83):** netns created+pinned, CNI wired real connectivity (ping the bridge gateway), container actually joins the netns (inode-equality proof of the setns pre_exec), and leak-free teardown (no dangling pin/mount/veth — containerd#6143 class) — `tests/netns_lifecycle.rs` green on ubuntu-latest. **#91: the container now gets a minimal `/dev`** (tmpfs + bind-mounted host null/zero/full/random/urandom/tty + std fd symlinks — rootless can't `mknod`); was device-less (snapshot carries no device nodes) so `/dev/null` users / shell job-control broke. CI `ns-net-isolation` /dev step green (write /dev/null + read /dev/zero + backgrounded job, no "can't open"). **#92: security flags — a cluster of silent no-ops fixed.** ns engine now ENFORCES `--read-only` (rootfs RO remount — non-recursive so `/dev`+`/dev/shm` stay writable; CI: write → EROFS, control writes OK) and `--shm-size` (sized `/dev/shm` tmpfs; CI: 20m write to a 16m shm fails, 8m ok). `--privileged`/`--cap-add`/`--cap-drop` now **honest-error (exit 2)** instead of silently no-op'ing (silent no-op on a security flag = false security); `--init` honest-staged. (Real cap enforcement + init tracked.) **#93: rootfs fidelity — snapshot no longer silently drops unreadable dirs.** `scan.rs` recorded only empty dirs via `read_dir().unwrap_or(false)`, so a dir whose `read_dir` failed (e.g. mode-700 `/root` snapshotted by a non-root process) was treated as non-empty and DROPPED (fail-open) → vanished from the materialized rootfs. Now records the dir when empty OR unreadable (fix is in lightr-index, so it benefits every engine's materialization). CI: `/root` (alpine, 700, root-owned) survives snapshot→hydrate. Unreadable *children* still need snapshot run with read access (can't capture what you can't read). |
| F-205 | vz engine boot | ✅ | **VALIDATED end-to-end on Intel x86_64** (i7-9750H, macOS 15.3.2, 2026-06-12): `lightr run --engine vz` boots a real microVM and runs the command — `/bin/echo`→0+stdout, `/bin/sh -c 'exit 7'`→**7**, `/bin/true`→0. The file exit-channel carries the REAL guest code, never a fabricated 0 (missing file ⇒ 255). 3 root-cause boot bugs fixed: (1) shim drove the VM on the **main** dispatch queue while blocking a semaphore → VM wedged in `.starting` forever → now a **dedicated serial queue**; (2) VZ-x86 boots a **bzImage** (x86 setup-header protocol) — a `vmlinux` ELF (even PVH) is rejected "Internal Virtualization error"; (3) virtiofs used `VZMultipleDirectoryShare` (nested rootfs under `/newroot/rootfs`) → now `VZSingleDirectoryShare`. Kernel via `scripts/build-kernel-x86.sh` (Linux 6.18.5 bzImage; virtio-pci/console/fs =y). 4 earlier latent bugs also fixed: pack_dir path, swift rpath, kernel sha256 pin, entitlement XML |
| F-206 | Apple kernel + Rust PID1 | ✅ | **VALIDATED end-to-end on Intel** (2026-06-12): `lightr-init` PID1 mounts the rootfs virtiofs share, reads the command (`CMD_FILE`), chroots, spawns, writes the REAL exit code (`EXIT_FILE`), powers off cleanly; the host reads the code back. Exit DELIVERY uses the **file channel** (macOS has NO host `AF_VSOCK` — the old vsock receiver was removed as dead code, decisions-log 2026-06-12). kernel-pack pipeline build→assemble→install→**run** all green; `verify_pack` wired into `install-pack`; `scripts/build-kernel-x86.sh` reproduces the bzImage. (arm64 sibling: `spikes/s5-vz-boot-arm64/`, owner-gated on ARM HW) |

## OCI & ecosystem (R2/R3)
| F | Feature | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| F-301 | oci import (layout/tar) | ✅ | A17, A17b/c/d (sha256, whiteout, hardlink) |
| F-302 | registry push/pull | ✅ | pull ✅ **hardened** (private-registry auth via ~/.docker/config.json, retry/backoff on 429/5xx, streaming blobs, typed HTTP status, multi-arch). **push ✅ shipped + VALIDATED (WP-PUSH, 2026-06-19):** `lightr oci push <store-ref> <target-ref>`. The store keeps a CAS filesystem TREE (BLAKE3 Manifest), NOT the original OCI blobs, so push **synthesizes** a spec-valid single-layer OCI image from the hydrated tree (tar→gzip the tree, layer digest = sha256 of the gzip, diff_id = sha256 of the uncompressed tar, OCI image manifest) and uploads it (HEAD-skip → POST upload → monolithic PUT blob → PUT manifest), reusing the pull machinery (auth/retry/typed-status; `fetch_docker_token` scope `push,pull`; `localhost`/`127.0.0.1` → http). **push-fidelity (2026-06-19):** `oci pull`/`import` now capture the ORIGINAL image config blob into the CAS (`Store::image_config_put`, an `imgmeta` sidecar keyed by ref — zero RefRecord/codec change, dedup'd); push re-emits it so **entrypoint/cmd/env/workingdir/os/arch are PRESERVED** (only `rootfs.diff_ids` is rewritten for the single synthesized layer, and `history` dropped to match). A ref with no captured config (a `snapshot`'d tree, or a pre-fidelity pull) falls back to a minimal Linux config. Honest boundary: the filesystem is re-expressed as ONE synthesized layer (original layer boundaries aren't kept — on-brand for the imageless CAS model), but the image **RUNS identically**. Validated end-to-end on Intel via a local `registry:2`: (a) `push alpine` → `docker pull` back → `docker run … cat /etc/alpine-release` = `3.24.1`, os=linux; (b) **fidelity: `pull nginx:alpine` (8 layers) → push → `docker inspect` shows Entrypoint `["/docker-entrypoint.sh"]` + Cmd `["nginx","-g","daemon off;"]` + WorkingDir `/` IDENTICAL to the original.** Store sidecar unit test; offline synth + `LIGHTR_REG_TESTS`-gated round-trip acceptance lane. |
| F-303 | volumes/binds (--mount) | ✅ | A9c grammar; mount unit |
| F-304 | networking (DNS/VPN/-p) | 🟡 | **`run -d -p HOST:CONTAINER` shipped (WP-NET1)** — daemonless userspace forward-proxy (the rootless-docker/podman model: slirp/pasta/gvproxy are userspace), supervisor-owned (lives with the run, torn down on `stop`/exit via Drop), multi-connection (thread-per-conn, sequential + concurrent). Ports NOT in the memo key (runtime, like `-p` in Docker; proven by `ports_excluded_from_key`). Native-detached path, with honest guards: `-p` requires `-d` (exit 2). Acceptance `net_published_run_is_reachable_then_torn_down` (real HTTP round-trip through the forwarder via `python3 -m http.server`, then `stop` → port closed). Compose port-binding (A24) unchanged. **`-p` for a Linux IMAGE on macOS shipped + VALIDATED (WP-NET2, 2026-06-18, Intel x86_64):** `run -d -p HOST:CONTAINER --engine vz --rootfs <img> -- <server>` boots the Linux container in a microVM under the supervisor (`spawn_detached_engine` → `supervise_vz`) and forwards `127.0.0.1:HOST → guest_ip:CONTAINER`. The guest gets its IP from kernel `ip=dhcp` (CONFIG_IP_PNP_DHCP=y, VZNATNetworkDeviceAttachment) and PID1 publishes it to `IP_FILE` (deterministic file channel, the sibling of EXIT_FILE — no `/var/db/dhcpd_leases` heuristic); the supervisor reads it + starts `portforward::start_to`. `stop` writes the guest `EXIT_FILE`, which the shim polls + force-stops (no new shim code). Proven end-to-end by `spikes/s5-vz-net/run.sh` (**GREEN**: boot alpine + busybox `nc` server, `curl 127.0.0.1:18080` → `lightr-vz-net` via guest `192.168.64.x`, `stop` → port closed + `exited 143` + no leaked supervisor). The old guard `-p`+vz → "Phase 2" is now `-p`+vz+`--rootfs` → ALLOWED; ns/wsl + vz-without-rootfs still honest-error. **Compose service discovery shipped + VALIDATED (WP-DISC, 2026-06-19):** every compose service learns its peers via env (`<PEER>_HOST=127.0.0.1` + `<PEER>_PORT=<container_port>`, the Docker-compose links convention; name sanitized non-alnum→`_`, uppercased) injected through the child's explicit env (`SpecOnDisk.env` → `.envs()`, replacing the racy process-global `set_var`). Native services share host loopback + bind `127.0.0.1:<container_port>`, so a peer reaches another DIRECTLY there (no proxy). Acceptance `a24b_compose_discovery_env` (a 2-service stack where `client` reaches `web` via `$WEB_HOST:$WEB_PORT` — real round-trip, validated). HONEST boundary: true name-DNS (`curl http://web`) is NOT delivered on the native engine (system `/etc/hosts` is process-global; can't be per-process) — that belongs to vz/ns Phase 2. **Phase 2 (honest remaining for full Docker networking):** name-DNS (`curl http://web`) via vz/ns · ns netns+veth+bridge (Linux, not testable on this Intel Mac) · foreground `-p` · udp · container↔container networks · `-P`/`--add-host`/`--hostname`/`--dns`. |
| F-305 | compose lazy | ✅ | A24 (0 services until connect; down cleans). Services now **hydrate their `image_ref` into the run cwd** (closed the R4 temp-dir shortcut) |
| F-306 | build step-memoized | ✅ | A22 (counter side-effect proves memo), A23 |
| F-307 | docker CLI compat | ✅ | A25 (build/images/unsupported→2) |
| F-308 | restart via OS supervisor | ✅ | A308: `supervise install/uninstall/list` GENERATES a launchd plist (macOS) / systemd user unit (Linux) under `~/.lightr/units/` + prints the opt-in `launchctl bootstrap` / `systemctl --user enable --now` command — **no daemon of ours, never auto-loaded** (A4 invariant holds: install/list leave 0 resident processes, plist passes `plutil -lint`). `RestartPolicy::{No,Always,OnFailure{max},UnlessStopped}` (fail-closed parse). Windows 🟡 (honest `Unsupported`; Task Scheduler = future ring) |
| F-309 | healthcheck/secrets/configs | ✅ | WP-A3: secrets/configs are in-key (name+ref-digest, like mounts), hydrated 0600/0644 to `<cwd>/.lightr/{secrets,configs}/<name>`, fail-closed on missing ref (honest on-disk boundary, no daemon/tmpfs); healthcheck probe wired into the detached supervisor (writes `<run>/health`, surfaced by `ps`, NOT in key); compose `secrets:`/`configs:`/`healthcheck:` parsed. Tests: secret-ref-changes-key, domain-separated, hydrate-path+mode, missing-ref-fails-closed, supervisor-flips-unhealthy, compose-schema |

| F | Feature | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| F-601 | single binary ≤10 MB | ✅ | release ~4.5 MB stripped (bench B7; 4,713,904 B, ≤10 MB target met). **CLI polish:** `lightr completions <shell>`, `lightr man`, `--version` with git-sha+build-date, top-level help examples (+ tests) |
| F-602 | `bench --vs-docker` + `bench-compare` | ✅ | `bench` cmd (B1–B11, CI gate); **`bench-compare` added (WP-C)** — head-to-head "humiliation" harness vs Docker/OrbStack/Apple `container`: workloads `install`/`materialize`/`cold-run`/`re-run`/`idle`/`build` (`--workload all` default; materialize = 1 GB real / tiny in tests), competitors detected on PATH (`docker`, `orb`/`orbstack`, `container`), **tense law: absent → SKIP row, never a fabricated number**; Lightr always measured (real index/CLI paths, median-of-N after warmup); side-by-side table + `--json` with `factor = competitor/lightr` only where BOTH measured (0-baseline ⇒ no fabricated ∞); honest header (machine class + present runtimes + "Apple-Silicon headline binds when run on AS"); marketing/proof harness, NO CI budget gate (that stays `bench`). **WP-D made the head-to-head REAL** (build-spec §7): competitor containers ARE spawned at marketing time behind a `ProbePolicy` spawn-guard — only the real CLI `run()` spawns; tests/CI run `NeverSpawn`, so a PRESENT docker still SKIPs and `cargo test` can never launch a container even on a docker-equipped runner (locked by a test). New axis **install footprint (#1)** = `du` of `Docker.app` vs the lightr binary (no spawn). Docker probes: cold/re-run = `docker run --rm alpine:latest true`; build = warm-cache 2nd `docker build` of an equivalent `FROM alpine` 3-step (scratch+RUN isn't docker-buildable); materialize = `docker cp` of 1 GB (cp-ingest as untimed setup, timed extract out). Every spawned op has a hard wall-clock timeout → SKIP on timeout/failure, never a fabricated number. **Authoritative run (2026-06-18, Intel macOS x86_64, docker 28.3.2) — Lightr obliterates Docker on ALL 6 axes:** install 451.7×, materialize (1 GB) 160.6×, cold-run 8.3×, re-run 48.1×, idle 0-vs-7 (∞, daemonless), build 69.6× → `docs/spec/benchmark-results.md`. The `--vs-docker` flag on `bench` is retained (version-overhead probe); `bench-compare` is the full harness. **+`cold-image` axis (WP-CI, 2026-06-19):** "get a real OS image ready from cold" — Lightr CoW-hydrates the image from its CAS (untimed `oci pull` setup, like "bytes already in CAS") vs Docker `docker pull` of the SAME image. Uses a DISTINCT image (`busybox:latest`, not the shared `alpine:latest` `TINY_IMAGE`) so the per-sample `rmi` cold-ness guard never disturbs the other probes; same image both sides = fair. CI-safe (the Lightr side hits the network, so it is NEVER called from a unit test; the NeverSpawn SKIP is asserted via the guard directly). **Measured 2026-06-19 (Intel, docker 28.3.2): lightr 63.0 ms vs docker 2428.8 ms = 38.5×.** |

## Platform coverage (omni wave, 2026-06-12 — ADR-0017)

One codebase, every desktop. Engine per platform; the daemonless core is portable
behind `cfg`. Honesty: "compiles + cross-checks clean" ≠ "runtime validated" — the
latter is marked per platform, never assumed.

| Platform | core (CAS/run/build) | isolation | build proof | runtime validated? |
|---|---|---|---|---|

- **Linux ns runtime — VALIDATED (2026-06-25):** runtime-proven on GitHub-hosted
  ubuntu-latest (cold-start benchmark + net-namespace isolation + CRI backend
  full netns/CNI lifecycle #83, all green; see F-204). Caveat: rootless ≠
  hostile-tenant boundary.
- **Honest-gated (WIN-PATH / runbook):** Windows runtime (named-pipe supervisor,
  WSL2 exec, ReFS block-clone) and arm64 vz boot — each has a one-command runbook
  or a CI job; none is claimed validated.
- `windows-sys` is target-gated (never pulled on unix builds); every Windows
  runtime path is `// WIN-PATH` with an honest probe/error + a correct fallback.

## Summary
- **✅ done + tested (411 tests):** the entire local product — store, index,
  all R0 verbs, run-control, gc, time-axis, OCI import (sha256-verified), build
  (memoized), lazy compose (services hydrate `image_ref`), docker compat, the
  full agent surface, schemas, CLI polish (completions/man/--version). **F-103
  view materialization ships as CoW hydrate** (real + tested). **vz engine
  runtime-validated on Intel x86_64** (F-205/F-206).
- **✅ ns engine (Linux) — validated 2026-06-25:** cold-start benchmark
  (~30.8 ms, ~4.05× vs rootless podman at same isolation) + net-namespace
  isolation + CRI backend full netns/CNI lifecycle (#83 — pin, connectivity,
  container-join, leak-free teardown), all green on GitHub-hosted ubuntu-latest
  (`docs/benchmarks/RESULTS.md`, F-204). Caveat: rootless ≠ hostile-tenant.
- **🟡 honest-gated:** wsl engine + arm64 vz boot (probe-truthful;
  HW-gated runbooks/CI — none claimed validated), pull-push (push future),
  deep-memo shim, microwave floor measurement, distribution (publish
  owner-gated `G-PUBLISH`, metadata + naming ready — `docs/RELEASE.md`).
- **⏳ future rings:** O(1) view backends (ADR-0013 spike — perf optimization,
  honest `Unsupported`, unwired), fc/cloud, Rosetta, mesh, Stage-2 sync,
  restart-via-OS, healthchecks. Each is a named ADR/ring, none claimed.
- Nothing in the whitepaper's record table is published beyond what a ✅
  bench row measured on the stated hardware.
