//! SKELETON-FREEZE: per-aspect lowering STUBS for the compose service fields
//! that are FROZEN in the model (`spec.rs`) but NOT yet lowered into the runtime
//! [`Service`] (`model.rs`).
//!
//! Each `lower_<aspect>` here is an honest no-op: the field is parsed and held in
//! the [`ServiceDef`], but the runtime `Service` type carries no slot for it yet,
//! so the current behavior is "ignored" — and these stubs reproduce exactly that
//! (byte-identical `Service`). A future compose-feature WP fills EXACTLY ONE of
//! these bodies (and widens `model.rs` for its target field), touching no sibling
//! aspect and not colliding on `lower.rs` beyond its already-present call site.
//!
//! Why a separate module: it keeps `lower.rs` (the dispatcher + the aspects that
//! ALREADY lower) under the godfile limit and gives every not-yet-lowered aspect
//! its own self-contained editable function.
//!
//! Convention for filling a stub:
//!  1. add the target field(s) to the runtime `Service` in `model.rs` (+
//!     `empty_service`), via that field's own WP;
//!  2. replace the body here with the lowering, reading from `def` and writing
//!     onto `svc`;
//!  3. add tests to `lower_tests.rs`.
//!
//! The `_` bindings below are deliberate: they document that the source field
//! exists and is intentionally not yet consumed (no `#[allow(unused)]`, no debt).
